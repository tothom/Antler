              Shift + click to also calculate how many elements which are
              actually using the parameters. That is how many elements has a
              value set for the parameter. This could take a long time to
              calculate because every element in the model must be checked.
              Keep in mind that a empty parameter value such as empty text is
              also counted as having a value. Only parameters which has never
              had a value assigned to it is counted as not having a value."
